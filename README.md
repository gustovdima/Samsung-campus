# Samsung-campus
My first course in android development (https://samsung-campus.kz)

This is a free android development course in the Java programming language that can only be entered by passing an entrance test,I'll attach my test results above. 
This course lasted 10 months. At the end of the course,
you need to protect your knowledge with a study project (I have to create an app to get a personal certificate and the jury members must choose the best project)
